# Core Rules

## 1. Attributes

### General Rules

Attributes can range from 1 to 13 (and in rare cases, above), and have a corresponding modifier, in accordance with the following table:

| Attribute | Modifier | Description |

| 3-4 | -1 | Weak |

| 7-8 | +1 | Strong |
| 9-10 | +2 | Excellent |
| 11-12 | +3 | Epic |
| 13+ | +4 | Superhuman| 

As a general rule, most humans have attributes between 3 and 8, some outstanding individuals reaching the Excellent (9-10) level.

Epic (11-12) is a level where something extraordinary is usually involved.

## 5. Traits

Traits are special abilities that provide passive bonuses or opportunities for your character, enhancing your General or Special Moves.

One trait can be added during character creation (if the CM uses this optional rule), and others can be earned during the game.

## 6. Resources

Compared to other values, resources are dynamic, their value can and should change during play.

### Advantage and Disadvantage

Advantage can be earned from a good preparation, setting a trap or choosing the right music at the right time. When using Advantage, a player rolls 3d6 instead of 2d6 and keeps the highest 2 of the results.

Disadvantage can be imposed by the MC, and mostly comes from bad preparation or adverse circumstances. When a player has Disadvantage, he roll 3d6 instead of 2d6 and keeps the lowest 2 of the results.

As a general rule - even though Advantage tokens are counted -, any number of Advantages and Disadvantages in the same situation negate each other, regardless of the net sum. This means, that if a character has both Advantage and Disadvantage in a certain situation, the roll is unaffected and the player uses the default 2d6 roll.
