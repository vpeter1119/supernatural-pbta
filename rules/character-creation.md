# Character Creation (Step by Step)

Follow these steps to create a Supernatural character from scratch!

## 1. Choose Playbook

Before anything else, you have to choose a character playbook. The playbook will determine some of your attributes, most of your abilities and will greatly influence your playstyle.

Read the description of the following Playbooks and pick the one you think you would enjoy the most!
- [Angel](playbooks/angel.md)
- [Demon](playbooks/demon.md)
- [Hunter](playbooks/hunter.md)
- [Vampire](playbooks/vampire.md)
- [Werewolf](playbooks/werewolf.md)
- [Witch](playbooks/witch.md)

## 2. Determine Attributes

Use one of the following methods to determine the values for the four Attributes: Body, Senses, Charm and Mind.

### Point-buy Method

When creating a character, players use the point-buy method by distributing 20 points among the 4 attributes. No attribute can be lower than 1 or higher than 10.

### Standard Array

Alternatively, players can assign an array of 7, 5, 5 and 3 to the four attributes.

### Roll For It!

Lastly, if the MC and players agree to use an old-school method, they can roll for the four attributes, but beware, this can result in unusually high or low average of scores compared to the A and B methods.

When using the “Roll for it!”-method, a player rolls 2d4 four times, then distributes the results among the four attributes.

This will yield stats between 2 and 8, the roll has an average result of 5.

## 2/B. Optional Rule: Adjust Attribute Scores for Playbook

After using one of the above methods for distributing attribute scores, add and subtract the relevant Playbook modifiers:

| Playbook | Body | Senses | Charm | Mind |
| -------- | ---- | ------ | ----- | ---- |
| Hunter | none | none | none | none |
| Demon | -1 | +1 | +1 | -1 |
| Angel | +1 | -1 | -1 | +1 |
| Vampire | +1 | +1 | -1 | -1 |
| Werewolf | +1 | +1 | -1 | -1 |
| Witch | -1 | -1 | +1 | +1 |
