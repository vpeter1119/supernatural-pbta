<h2 id="1-choose-playbook">1. Choose Playbook</h2>
<p>Before anything else, you have to choose a character playbook. The playbook will determine some of your attributes, most of your abilities and will greatly influence your playstyle.</p>
<p>Read the description of the following Playbooks and pick the one you think you would enjoy the most!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="playbooks/angel.md">Angel</a></li>
<li><a href="playbooks/demon.md">Demon</a></li>
<li><a href="playbooks/hunter.md">Hunter</a></li>
<li><a href="playbooks/vampire.md">Vampire</a></li>
<li><a href="playbooks/werewolf.md">Werewolf</a></li>
<li><a href="playbooks/witch.md">Witch</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-determine-attributes">2. Determine Attributes</h2>
<p>Use one of the following methods to determine the values for the four Attributes: Body, Senses, Charm and Mind.</p>
<h3 id="point-buy-method">Point-buy Method</h3>
<p>When creating a character, players use the point-buy method by distributing 20 points among the 4 attributes. No attribute can be lower than 1 or higher than 10.</p>
<h3 id="standard-array">Standard Array</h3>
<p>Alternatively, players can assign an array of 7, 5, 5 and 3 to the four attributes.</p>
<h3 id="roll-for-it">Roll For It!</h3>
<p>Lastly, if the MC and players agree to use an old-school method, they can roll for the four attributes, but beware, this can result in unusually high or low average of scores compared to the A and B methods.</p>
<p>When using the &quot;Roll for it!&quot;-method, a player rolls 2d4 four times, then distributes the results among the four attributes.</p>
<p>This will yield stats between 2 and 8, the roll has an average result of 5.</p>
<h2 id="2b-optional-rule-adjust-attribute-scores-for-playbook">2/B. Optional Rule: Adjust Attribute Scores for Playbook</h2>
<p>After using one of the above methods for distributing attribute scores, add and subtract the relevant Playbook modifiers:</p>

<h2 id="3-player-moves">3. Player moves</h2>

<h3 id="general-moves">General Moves</h3>

<h2 id="4-character-development">4. Character Development</h2>
<p>When leveling up, characters gain the following:</p>
<insert table here>

<h2 id="5-traits">5. Traits</h2>
<p>Traits are special abilities that provide passive bonuses or opportunities for your character, enhancing your General or Special Moves.</p>
<p>One trait can be added during character creation (if the CM uses this optional rule), and others can be earned during the game.</p>
<h2 id="6-resources">6. Resources</h2>
<p>Compared to other values, resources are dynamic, their value can and should change during play.</p>
<h3 id="advantage-and-disadvantage">Advantage and Disadvantage</h3>
<p>Advantage can be earned from a good preparation, setting a trap or choosing the right music at the right time. When using Advantage, a player rolls 3d6 instead of 2d6 and keeps the highest 2 of the results.</p>
<p>Disadvantage can be imposed by the MC, and mostly comes from bad preparation or adverse circumstances. When a player has Disadvantage, he roll 3d6 instead of 2d6 and keeps the lowest 2 of the results.</p>
<p>As a general rule - even though Advantage tokens are counted -, any number of Advantages and Disadvantages in the same situation negate each other, regardless of the net sum. This means, that if a character has both Advantage and Disadvantage in a certain situation, the roll is unaffected and the player uses the default 2d6 roll.</p>
