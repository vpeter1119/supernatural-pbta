# Core Rules

## 1. Attributes

### General Rules

Attributes can range from 1 to 13 (and in rare cases, above), and have a corresponding modifier, in accordance with the following table:

| Attribute | Modifier | Description |
| --------- | -------- | ----------- |
| 1-2 | -2 | Pathetic |
| 3-4 | -1 | Weak |
| 5-6 | 0 | Average |
| 7-8 | +1 | Strong |
| 9-10 | +2 | Excellent |
| 11-12 | +3 | Epic |
| 13+ | +4 | Superhuman| 

As a general rule, most humans have attributes between 3 and 8, some outstanding individuals reaching the Excellent (9-10) level.

Epic (11-12) is a level where something extraordinary is usually involved.

Only certain supernatural creatures or exceptionally (and supernaturally) gifted humans can have an attribute score of 13 or higher.

### Methods to Determine Attributes

#### Point-buy Method

When creating a character, players use the point-buy method by distributing 20 points among the 4 attributes. No attribute can be lower than 1 or higher than 10.

#### Standard Array

Alternatively, players can assign an array of 7, 5, 5 and 3 to the four attributes.

#### Roll For It!

Lastly, if the MC and players agree to use an old-school method, they can roll for the four attributes, but beware, this can result in unusually high or low average of scores compared to the A and B methods.

When using the “Roll for it!”-method, a player rolls 2d4 four times, then distributes the results among the four attributes.

This will yield stats between 2 and 8, the roll has an average result of 5.

#### Optional Rule: Class Attribute Modifiers

After using one of the above methods for distributing attribute scores, players then add the class modifiers (see below) to those.
